/*
 * Sunrise and sunset from sunrise-sunset.org.
 *
 * The request is built from connect.h (CONNECT_SUN_API_URL, made of the
 * latitude/longitude there), the answer is JSON.  Only the two fields
 * "sunrise" and "sunset" are used; they arrive as UTC timestamps
 * ("2026-10-18T05:38:23+00:00") and are converted to local time, so the result
 * follows the time zone from connect.h including summer time.
 *
 * The values end up in clock.c (clock_set_sun_times()), the rest of the program
 * reads them with clock_sunrise() / clock_sunset().
 *
 * HTTPS needs a valid system clock (certificate check), so call this after the
 * NTP sync.
